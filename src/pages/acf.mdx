# Template Based Architecture

As the title suggests, our currents sites are a primarily composed of page templates. At heart of this approach, we depend on a plugin known as ACF. On this page, we'll dive into the different ways we leverage ACF to quickly build templates for our clients. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## File Structure {{ tag: 'ACF', label: 'Template Architecture' }}

<Row>
  <Col>

    Here we want to focus on two important folders within the theme directory, namely the ```template-pages``` and ```template-parts``` folders.

    ### Template pages directory
    Contains all of the custom .php template files for the site.

    ### Template parts directory
    Contains all of the custom .php component files for the site.

    ### Default templates
    There are default templates that exist natively within Wordpress, such as single.php (posts),page.php (default page template), index.php (blog archive), and others. These templates are not located within the template-pages directory, but rather the theme root directory

    <Note>
      ACF field groups can still be used within these templates. However, it's important to note that for templates single.php we often use content directly from the Wordpress Block Editor, for the sake of maximizing content writers' productivity (more on this later).

This endpoint allows you to add a new contact to your contact list in Protocol. To add a contact, you must provide their Protocol username and phone number.

### Flexible Layouts

This endpoint allows you to add a new contact to your
contact list in Protocol. To add a contact, you must provide their Protocol
username and phone number.

### Static Layouts

This endpoint allows you to add a new contact to your
contact list in Protocol. To add a contact, you must provide their Protocol
username and phone number.

## Content writing experience {{ tag: 'BACKEND', label: 'Content Editor' }}

It's important to consider what the experience is like for content writers whenever they are updating or creating new pages using the flexible layout or static layout paradigms.

### Flexible Layouts

The position of all sections within a page are free from the page design. Within a flexible system, copy writers can change the position of a section, as well as adding an entierly new instance of a section. This gives more freedom to the copy writer when determining the proper layout of a page, while still contrainsing them within the intended design.

### Static Layouts

Within the static layout paradigm, The position of all sections within a page are determined by the page design. We aim for as close to a 1 to 1 representation as possible. This means that content writers can only change the content within elements of the page, while being locked from changing their appearance or position (unless an ACF field exists for those parameters, of course ðŸ™ƒ).

## Thresholds

### Static

- Custom page template
- Content does not change very often
- Brochure pages (aka not blogs)
- Highly designed
- Wordpress loop pages (blog roll)

### Flexible

- Content might change
- Custom Post Types
- Highly designed, but also dynamic content
- Default Page Template

### Gutenberg

- Posts
- Custom Post Types
- ACF Gutenberg Blocks
- Default Page Template
- Highly dynamic content

How do we implement Gutenberg? Is Gutenberg the next-gen Wordpress experience that we need to shift to? Is our current process the best we can be using?

- Block Based Architecture (Block Template)
- Hybrid Based Architecture (Classic Template w/ACF Gutenberg)
