# Exploring Block Theme Development and Custom Gutenberg Blocks

## Block Theme Development: Building with Blocks

Block theme development breaks a website into reusable parts. These parts can be customized a lot within the editor, giving the user design flexibility. A great example of this approach is the WPEngine Frost theme.

## Pros and Cons of Block Theme Development

Using block themes has good points, but there are trade-offs. Most customization is done in the backend editor, similar to tools like Elementor. Implementing custom styling requires us to edit a them.json file within theme director. This can slow development time a bit, and limit us to the built in theming options Wordpress provides. Although this gives a lot of freedom to the client to make changes on the design of the site, some clients like would prefer this, like Nick from SEO Testing.

## Custom Gutenberg Blocks: Crafting Uniqueness

Creating custom Gutenberg blocks gives unique control. We would have the ability to not only customize the front-end ui of the site, but _also_ the backend editor ui. This can help solve tricky challenges (think something like the Openhouse Adbar widget, but as a gutenberg block instead), but don't suit everyday template work due to complexities.

## Balancing Both: Finding the Middle Ground

A balanced strategy works best. For a flexible yet custom site we can stick to normal page templates. Use Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for pages, and Gutenberg blocks for dynamic content like blogs. Whenever Gutenberg block requires a complex design, we can leverage ACF Gutenberg Blocks to implement. There are minor trade-offs to ACF Gutenberg Blocks, but the fast development time outweighs concerns.
