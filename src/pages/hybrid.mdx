  'On this page, weâ€™ll look into developing within a hybrid system of Block + Template theme development.'

# Hybrid Based Architecture

The TL;DR is that we basically built sites like how we usually do. Custom pages with ACF groups for each page. However, when using blogs, cpts, or any other type of content that is dynamic, we will _only_ use Gutenberg blocks & custom ACF gutenberg blocks (not to be confused with traditionaly ACF fields). {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Custom Pages & Default Page Template

- Use traditional ACF groups.
- Style with Tailwind

## Blogs & CPS

- Use default Gutenberg blocks.
- Use ACF blocks for more custom designs.
- Style with Tailwind
